# 1.
First i have drafted the project and hard coded all the values and i planned to use Material-Ui wich will make the work easy for stayling the compoents.Then i planned to take the values which user is writing in input field and save them somewhere, to turn uncontrol form to control form.And then i planned to create new component to render the lists.that time i needed somehow to have access to the values which user inputed i passed them throw props to another component from where i can work with them.Once i got the new input i set to my created array list.So then later i can loop throw the array and print each of the elements.
# 2.
To get access to value from input filed from another component
# 3.
For small projects i guess its okay to use props as we dont have to many components, i think it was easiest way for me to get it done this way.
# 4. 
To useContex API or somekind of state managment where we can have access to data from all part of our application
